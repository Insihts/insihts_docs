# Reset User Progress

You can reset the progress of a user for a specific workflow or all workflows. This can be useful when you want to test the onboarding experience again or when you want to reset the progress for a specific user. You can reset the progress from the SDK or from the Insihts Workflows Cloud.

## Reset from SDK

To reset from the SDK, make sure you [identify the user first](/getting-started/identify-users). After the user is identified, you can call one of the following functions to reset the progress for the given `userId`.

### Reset Single Workflow

To reset a specific workflow for a user, you can call the `resetWorkflow` function with the workflow human ID as an argument. To get the workflow human ID, head over to the Settings tab of the workflow in the Insihts Workflows Cloud.

```js
import { resetWorkflow } from "@insihts/workflow";

// Reset single workflow
resetWorkflow("my-workflow");
```

### Reset All Workflows

To reset all workflows for a user, you can call the `resetAllWorkflows` function.

```js
import { resetAllWorkflows } from "@insihts/workflow";

// Reset all workflows
resetAllWorkflows();
```

## Reset from Insihts Workflows Cloud

Similarly to the SDK, you can reset user progress from the Insihts Workflows Cloud.

### Reset All Workflows



To reset all workflows for a user, head over to project settings in the Insihts Workflows Cloud and enter the `userId` you want to reset the progress for and confirm the action. This will reset the progress for the given `userId` for all workflows in the project.

### Reset Single Workflow



To reset a specific workflow for a user, head over to the workflow settings in the Insihts Workflows Cloud and enter the `userId` you want to reset the progress for and confirm the action. This will reset the progress for the given `userId` for the specific workflow.
