# Identify Users

For workflows to show up only once to a user, you need to identify the user. This is done by passing a `userId` parameter to the `init` function. This will allow you to count unique users that have seen your workflows and show the workflows only once to a specific user.

```js
import { init } from "@insihts/js";

init({
  // Unique identifier for the user
  // Prefer database ID over email if you're concerned about privacy of your users
  userId: "xxxx",

  projectId: "...",
});
```

The `userId` parameter can be any unique identifier for the user. We recommend using a database ID or a UUID. We hash the user ID on the client side before sending it to our servers to protect your users' privacy.

## Adding User Properties

To target your workflows to specific users, you can optionally pass user properties to the `init` function. These properties can be used to target workflows to specific users based on their properties.

```js
import { init } from "@insihts/js";

init({
  userId: "xxxx",
  projectId: "...",
  userProperties: {
    email: "info@insihts.org",
    name: "John Doe",
    plan: "premium",
  },
});
```

To protect your users' privacy, Insihts Workflows does not store any personal data about your users. When you set up targeting based on user properties, the evaluation is done on the client side. This means that the user data is never sent to our servers.

## Reset User Progress

You can reset which workflows the user has already seen, either by calling a function from the SDK or by entering `userId` manually in the Insihts Cloud.
