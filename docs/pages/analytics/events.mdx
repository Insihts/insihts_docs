# Basics: Track Events in Insights

Besides pageviews, Insights also allows you to track custom events that occur on your website. There are two ways to record events in Insights: using the data attributes property or JavaScript.

<Steps>

### Using Data Attributes

To enable events, simply add a special data property to the element you want to track.

For example, you might have a button with the following code:

```html
<button id="signup-button">Sign up</button>
```

Add a data property with the following format:

```html
data-insihts-event="{event-name}"
```

Your button element would now look like this:

```html
<button id="signup-button" data-insihts-event="Signup button">Sign up</button>
```

When the user clicks on this button, Insights will record an event named **Signup button**.

You can optionally pass along `event_data` with the `data-insihts-event-*` annotation:

```html
<button 
  id="signup-button" 
  data-insihts-event="Signup button"
  data-insihts-event-email="bob@aol.com"
  data-insihts-event-id="123">
  Sign up
</button>
```

The additional properties will result in:

```json
{ email: "bob@aol.com", id: "123" }
```

being recorded with the **Signup button** event name.

**Note:**
- Event data cannot be sent without an event name.
- All event data will be saved as strings using this method. If you want to save event data as numeric, dates, booleans, etc., use the JavaScript method below.
- Other event listeners inside the element will not be triggered.

### Using JavaScript

You can also record events manually using the `window.insihts` object. To accomplish the same thing as the above data-* method, you can do:

```js
const button = document.getElementById('signup-button');

button.onclick = () => insihts.track('Signup button');
```

In this case, Insights will record an event named **Signup button**.

If you want to record dynamic data, refer to the Tracker functions in the Insights documentation.

### View Events

Once your events are recorded, they will be available on your website's **Events** page.

![Events Page](https://insihts.com)

### View Event Properties

Your custom data can be accessed under the **Properties** tab on the **Events** page. This section will show you all the custom data properties you saved, as well as a breakdown of all the values.
